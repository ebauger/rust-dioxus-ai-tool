# Project Plan: Smart File Selection on Workspace Open

**Goal:** When a user opens a workspace, automatically select files. If a `.gitignore` file exists at the workspace root, select all files initially, then deselect any files or directories matching patterns in `.gitignore`. If no `.gitignore` file exists, deselect all files by default.

---

**Epic 1: Workspace Initialization and File Discovery**

*   **Story 1.1: Detect Workspace Opening Event**
    *   `[x]` Task: Identify the specific event, callback, or lifecycle method within the application that reliably signals a new workspace has been fully initialized and its root path is known.
    *   `[x]` Task: Implement a primary handler function that subscribes to or is triggered by this "workspace opened/loaded" event.
    *   `[x]` Task: Ensure the handler function accurately captures the absolute file system path to the root of the newly opened workspace.
    *   `[x]` Task: Add logging (e.g., to console or internal logs) to confirm the handler is triggered and the correct workspace path is obtained.

*   **Story 1.2: `.gitignore` File Locator**
    *   `[x]` Task: Implement a function `check_for_gitignore(workspace_root_path)` that takes the workspace root path as an argument.
    *   `[x]` Task: This function should construct the expected path to `.gitignore` (i.e., `workspace_root_path + "/.gitignore"`).
    *   `[x]` Task: The function should check if a file exists at this specific path.
    *   `[x]` Task: The function should return the full, absolute path to `.gitignore` if it exists, otherwise it should return `null` (or an equivalent sentinel value indicating absence).

*   **Story 1.3: Comprehensive File Listing**
    *   `[x]` Task: Implement a function `get_all_workspace_files(workspace_root_path)` that recursively traverses all directories and subdirectories starting from `workspace_root_path`.
    *   `[x]` Task: This function must return a flat list of strings, where each string is a file path *relative* to the `workspace_root_path` (e.g., `src/main.js`, `assets/image.png`).
    *   `[x]` Task: The file listing must explicitly exclude the `.git` directory and all its contents.
    *   `[x]` Task: Consider how symbolic links will be handled: for this initial version, list the link itself but do not follow it into linked directories to prevent infinite loops and simplify scope.
    *   `[x]` Task: Implement basic error handling for file system operations (e.g., log a warning and skip if a directory is unreadable due to permissions, but continue processing other accessible parts).

**Epic 2: `.gitignore` Parsing and Pattern Matching**

*   **Story 2.1: Reading `.gitignore` Content**
    *   `[x]` Task: Implement a function `read_gitignore_patterns(gitignore_file_path)` that takes the absolute path to a `.gitignore` file.
    *   `[x]` Task: This function should read the entire content of the `.gitignore` file.
    *   `[x]` Task: It should split the content into individual lines.
    *   `[x]` Task: Handle potential file I/O errors gracefully (e.g., if the file, previously detected, becomes unreadable).
    *   `[x]` Task: Return a list of raw string lines from the file.

*   **Story 2.2: Pre-processing `.gitignore` Lines**
    *   `[x]` Task: Implement a function `preprocess_gitignore_lines(raw_lines)` that takes the list of raw lines from `read_gitignore_patterns`.
    *   `[x]` Task: For each line, remove leading and trailing whitespace.
    *   `[x]` Task: Filter out (ignore) any line that is empty after trimming whitespace.
    *   `[x]` Task: Filter out (ignore) any line that starts with a `#` character (comments).
    *   `[x]` Task: Return a new list containing only the processed, effective pattern strings.

*   **Story 2.3: Implementing `.gitignore` Pattern Matching Logic**
    *   *Note: This is the most complex part. Consider if a well-tested third-party library for `.gitignore` pattern matching is available and suitable for the project's language/environment. If implementing from scratch, extreme care is needed.* -> Used `ignore` crate.
    *   `[x]` Task: Research the full `.gitignore` pattern specification, including:
        *   `[x]` Literal matching (`file.txt`).
        *   `[x]` Wildcard `*` (matches anything except `/`).
        *   `[x]` Wildcard `?` (matches any single character except `/`).
        *   `[x]` Character sets `[]`.
        *   `[x]` Globstar `**` (matches zero or more directories).
        *   `[x]` Patterns ending with `/` (specify a directory).
        *   `[x]` Patterns starting with `/` (anchor to the workspace root).
        *   `[x]` Patterns containing `/` (path-specific relative to `.gitignore` location).
        *   `[x]` Negation patterns starting with `!` (un-ignore a file).
    *   `[x]` Task: Implement a core function `is_file_ignored(relative_file_path, processed_patterns, workspace_root)` that takes a file's relative path, the list of preprocessed `.gitignore` patterns, and the workspace root.
    *   `[x]` Task: Inside `is_file_ignored`:
        *   `[x]` Task: Iterate through the `processed_patterns` *in order*. The last matching pattern for a given path determines its status (with `!` negating). (Handled by `ignore` crate)
        *   `[x]` Task: For each pattern, convert it into a regular expression or use a glob-matching utility suitable for `.gitignore` syntax. (Handled by `ignore` crate)
            *   `[x]` Task: Ensure `*` does not cross directory boundaries unless `**` is used. (Handled by `ignore` crate)
            *   `[x]` Task: Correctly handle anchoring for patterns starting with `/`. (Handled by `ignore` crate)
            *   `[x]` Task: Correctly handle directory-only patterns (ending with `/`). This means the pattern `build/` should match `build/file.txt` and `build/subdir/another.txt`. (Handled by `ignore` crate)
        *   `[x]` Task: Track if a path is matched by any ignore pattern and separately if it's matched by a negation pattern. The final decision for a path: it is ignored if the last relevant pattern matching it is an ignore pattern; it is not ignored if the last relevant pattern matching it is a negation pattern. (Handled by `ignore::Match::is_ignore()`)
    *   `[x]` Task: Return `true` from `is_file_ignored` if the file should be excluded based on the patterns, `false` otherwise.

*   **Story 2.4: Unit Testing for Pattern Matching**
    *   `[x]` Task: Create a comprehensive test suite for `is_file_ignored`.
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Simple file match (`config.ini` matches `config.ini`).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Simple directory match (`logs/` matches `logs/error.log` and `logs/access/something.log`).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Wildcard match (`*.tmp` matches `data.tmp` and `src/temp.tmp`).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Globstar match (`foo/**/bar.txt` matches `foo/bar.txt` and `foo/a/b/bar.txt`).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Anchored match (`/root.file` matches `root.file` but not `src/root.file`).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Path-specific match (`docs/README.md` matches `docs/README.md` but not `README.md`).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Negation (`!important.md`, with `*.md` also present).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Order of precedence (e.g. `*.log` then `!debug.log` then `important/debug.log` for path `important/debug.log`).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Patterns with leading/trailing spaces (should have been trimmed and match correctly).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Files within an ignored directory (e.g. if `build/` is ignored, `build/app.exe` should be ignored).
    *   `[x]` Test Case: Negated file inside an ignored directory (e.g. `build/`, `!build/special.dll`).

**Epic 3: Determining Final File Selection State**

*   **Story 3.1: Orchestrating the Selection Logic**
    *   `[x]` Task: In the main "workspace opened" handler (from Story 1.1), after getting the workspace root:
        *   `[x]` Task: Call `check_for_gitignore(workspace_root)`.
        *   `[x]` Task: Call `get_all_workspace_files(workspace_root)` to get the list of all relative file paths.
        *   `[x]` Task: Initialize a data structure (e.g., a Set or Map) to store the paths of selected files. Let's call it `final_selected_files`.
    *   `[x]` Task: If `check_for_gitignore` returned a path (meaning `.gitignore` exists):
        *   `[x]` Task: Call `read_gitignore_patterns` with the path.
        *   `[x]` Task: Call `preprocess_gitignore_lines` with the raw patterns.
        *   `[x]` Task: For each `file_path` in the `all_workspace_files` list:
            *   `[x]` Task: Call `is_file_ignored(file_path, processed_patterns, workspace_root)`.
            *   `[x]` Task: If `is_file_ignored` returns `false` (file is NOT ignored), add `file_path` to `final_selected_files`.
    *   `[x]` Task: If `check_for_gitignore` returned `null` (no `.gitignore`):
        *   `[x]` Task: Ensure `final_selected_files` remains empty (or is explicitly cleared), effectively unselecting all files.
    *   `[ ]` Task: Make `final_selected_files` (or the derived selection state for each file) available to other application modules, particularly the UI.

---

**Epic 4: UI Integration and State Propagation**

*   **Story 4.1: Define Internal Representation of File Selection**
    *   `[ ]` Task: Determine how the application's existing file model (if any, e.g., objects representing files in a tree view) will store or be associated with the "selected" state. This could be a boolean property on each file object, or a separate lookup structure.
*   **Story 4.2: Update UI to Reflect Selection**
    *   `[ ]` Task: Implement a function or mechanism that iterates through all files currently displayed or managed by the UI.
    *   `[ ]` Task: For each file item in the UI, query its selection status based on the `final_selected_files` set (or the derived state from Story 3.1).
    *   `[ ]` Task: Visually update each UI file item:
        *   If selected: Mark as selected (e.g., check a checkbox, apply a specific style/icon).
        *   If unselected: Mark as unselected (e.g., uncheck a checkbox, apply default style/icon).
*   **Story 4.3: Trigger UI Refresh**
    *   `[ ]` Task: Ensure that once `final_selected_files` is fully computed in the "workspace opened" handler, a UI refresh/update operation is explicitly triggered to make the changes visible to the user.
    *   `[ ]` Task: Optimize this UI update to be efficient, especially for workspaces with thousands of files (e.g., batch updates, virtualized lists if applicable).

**Epic 5: Advanced Considerations & Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial MVP but good to note)**

*   **Story 5.1: Handling Nested `.gitignore` Files**
    *   `[ ]` Task: Research the cascading/overriding rules for `.gitignore` files located in subdirectories.
    *   `[ ]` Task: (Future) If supporting, modify `is_file_ignored` to discover and apply patterns from all relevant `.gitignore` files in the path hierarchy.
*   **Story 5.2: Performance for Extremely Large Workspaces**
    *   `[ ]` Task: After initial implementation, profile the entire process on a known large repository.
    *   `[ ]` Task: (Future) If bottlenecks are found in file listing or pattern matching, investigate optimizations (e.g., asynchronous file system access, compiled regex caching, more advanced glob matching algorithms).
*   **Story 5.3: Considering Global Git Ignore (`core.excludesFile`)**
    *   `[ ]` Task: Research how Git's global ignore file (`~/.config/git/ignore` or `core.excludesFile` in `~/.gitconfig`) interacts with repository-local `.gitignore`.
    *   `[ ]` Task: (Future) Decide if this feature should also respect the user's global git ignore settings.
*   **Story 5.4: User Feedback During Processing**
    *   `[ ]` Task: (Future) For very large workspaces, consider providing feedback to the user that this initial file selection process is underway (e.g., a status message or subtle loading indicator).
