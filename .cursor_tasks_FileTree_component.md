## Project: Implement FileTree Component

**Goal:** Replace the existing `FileList` component with a new `FileTree` component that provides a hierarchical view of files and folders, mirroring the selection and interaction logic of the provided `file_tree.html`.

---

### Story 1: Define Core Data Structures for the File Tree

**Description:** Establish the fundamental Rust structs and enums that will represent the nodes in the file tree, their types, selection states, and expansion states.

*   [x] **Task 1.1:** Define `TreeNodeType` enum (`File`, `Folder`) in `src/components/file_tree.rs`.
*   [x] **Task 1.2:** Define `NodeSelectionState` enum (`Selected`, `NotSelected`, `PartiallySelected`) in `src/components/file_tree.rs`.
*   [x] **Task 1.3:** Define `FileTreeNode` struct in `src/components/file_tree.rs`.
    *   Fields: `id: usize` (unique identifier), `name: String`, `path: PathBuf`, `node_type: TreeNodeType`, `children: Vec<FileTreeNode>`, `is_expanded: Signal<bool>` (for folders), `selection_state: Signal<NodeSelectionState>`, `depth: usize`.
*   [x] **Task 1.4:** (Discussion Point for Agent) Decide on ID generation strategy (e.g., simple counter during tree construction).
*   [x] **Task 1.5:** Add necessary imports (`std::path::PathBuf`, `dioxus::prelude::*`) to `src/components/file_tree.rs`.

---

### Story 2: Implement Tree Construction Logic

**Description:** Develop the functionality to convert a flat list of `FileInfo` objects (representing file paths) into a hierarchical `Vec<FileTreeNode>` structure.

*   [x] **Task 2.1:** Create a helper function `build_tree_from_file_info(files: &[FileInfo], selected_paths: &HashSet<PathBuf>) -> Vec<FileTreeNode>` in `src/components/file_tree.rs`.
*   [x] **Task 2.2:** Implement logic within `build_tree_from_file_info` to parse `PathBuf` from `FileInfo` and create intermediate folder nodes as needed.
    *   Ensure correct parent-child relationships.
    *   Assign unique `id` to each node.
    *   Initialize `is_expanded` (e.g., root expanded, others collapsed or based on a heuristic).
    *   Initialize `selection_state` based on `selected_paths` (initial state).
    *   Set `depth` for each node.
*   [x] **Task 2.3:** Handle edge case: empty `files` input.
*   [x] **Task 2.4:** Write unit tests in `src/components/file_tree_test.rs` for `build_tree_from_file_info`:
    *   Test with a simple flat list of files in the same directory.
    *   Test with files in nested directories.
    *   Test with an empty list of files.
    *   Test correct initialization of `id`, `name`, `path`, `node_type`, `depth`.

### Story 3: Create the Basic `FileTree` Dioxus Component

**Description:** Define the main `FileTree` Dioxus component, its props, and initial rendering logic for a single level of nodes (without recursion yet).

*   [x] **Task 3.1:** Define `FileTreeProps` struct in `src/components/file_tree.rs`.
    *   Props: `all_files: Vec<FileInfo>`, `selected_paths: Signal<HashSet<PathBuf>>`, `on_select_all: EventHandler<()>`, `on_deselect_all: EventHandler<()>`.
*   [x] **Task 3.2:** Create the `FileTree` component function `pub fn FileTree(props: FileTreeProps) -> Element` in `src/components/file_tree.rs`.
*   [x] **Task 3.3:** Inside `FileTree`, use a `use_signal` to store the constructed `Vec<FileTreeNode>` (e.g., `tree_nodes`).
*   [x] **Task 3.4:** Use `use_effect` to call `build_tree_from_file_info` when `props.all_files` or `props.selected_paths` changes and update the `tree_nodes` signal.
*   [x] **Task 3.5:** Implement initial RSX to iterate over the top-level `tree_nodes` and render a basic representation (name and type, checkbox).
*   [x] **Task 3.6:** Create `src/components/file_tree_test.rs` if it doesn't exist.
*   [x] **Task 3.7:** Add `mod file_tree;` and `mod file_tree_test;` to `src/components/mod.rs`.
*   [x] **Task 3.8:** Add `pub use file_tree::FileTree;` to `src/components/mod.rs`.

---

### Story 4: Implement Recursive Rendering of Tree Nodes

**Description:** Create a recursive sub-component or function to render each node in the tree, including its children, indentation, and icons.

*   [x] **Task 4.1:** Define a new Dioxus component `FileTreeNodeDisplay(node: FileTreeNode, selected_paths: Signal<HashSet<PathBuf>>)` within `src/components/file_tree.rs`. (Adjusted prop to `node: FileTreeNode` which itself contains Signals, not `node: Signal<FileTreeNode>`).
    *   Alternatively, a recursive `rsx!` macro call within `FileTree` itself. A sub-component is often cleaner.
*   [x] **Task 4.2:** In `FileTreeNodeDisplay`, render the node's checkbox, icon (folder/file), and name.
    *   Folder icon should change based on `node.is_expanded.read()`. (e.g., "📂" for expanded, "📁" for collapsed).
    *   File icon: "📄".
*   [x] **Task 4.3:** Apply indentation based on `node.depth` (e.g., `style: "padding-left: {node.depth * 20}px;"`).
*   [x] **Task 4.4:** If `node.node_type == TreeNodeType::Folder` and `node.is_expanded.read()` is true, recursively call `FileTreeNodeDisplay` for each child in `node.children`.
*   [x] **Task 4.5:** Update `FileTree` component's RSX to use `FileTreeNodeDisplay` for its top-level nodes.

---

### Story 5: Implement Folder Expansion and Collapse

**Description:** Add interactivity to allow users to expand and collapse folder nodes.

*   [x] **Task 5.1:** In `FileTreeNodeDisplay`, add an `onclick` handler to the row or folder icon of a folder node.
*   [x] **Task 5.2:** The `onclick` handler should toggle the `node.is_expanded.write().toggle()` value.
*   [x] **Task 5.3:** Ensure clicking a file row does not attempt to expand/collapse.

---

### Story 6: Implement Checkbox State Synchronization and Visuals

**Description:** Ensure checkboxes visually represent the `NodeSelectionState` (checked, unchecked, indeterminate) and that their state is derived from the `selected_paths` prop and hierarchical logic.

*   [x] **Task 6.1:** In `FileTreeNodeDisplay`, bind the checkbox's `checked` attribute.
    *   `checked: node.read().selection_state.read() == NodeSelectionState::Selected`
*   [x] **Task 6.2:** Bind the checkbox's `indeterminate` attribute. (Implemented using `dioxus_desktop::use_window().webview.evaluate_script()`)
    *   `indeterminate: node.read().selection_state.read() == NodeSelectionState::PartiallySelected`
*   [x] **Task 6.3:** Modify `build_tree_from_file_info` or a subsequent processing step to correctly initialize `selection_state` for each node based on `selected_paths` and children's states. This involves:
    *   A file node is `Selected` if its path is in `selected_paths`, else `NotSelected`. (Handled in `build_tree_from_file_info` -> `FileTreeNodeBlueprint`)
    *   A folder node's state is `Selected` if all children are `Selected`.
    *   A folder node's state is `PartiallySelected` if some (but not all) children are `Selected` or `PartiallySelected`.
    *   A folder node's state is `NotSelected` if no children are `Selected` or `PartiallySelected`.
    *   (This logic is handled in `build_tree_from_file_info` and `convert_blueprint_to_file_tree_node_recursive` through the `selection_state` field of `FileTreeNodeBlueprint` and `FileTreeNode`)

---

### Story 7: Implement Selection Logic (Part 1 - Node & Descendants)

**Description:** Implement the core logic for selecting/deselecting a node and propagating that change to all its descendants.

*   [x] **Task 7.1:** Create a helper function `set_node_and_descendants_state(node: &mut FileTreeNode, new_state: bool, selected_paths_writer: &mut WriteSignal<HashSet<PathBuf>>)` in `src/components/file_tree.rs`. (Adjusted: Logic integrated into `oninput` handler and `FileTreeNode::collect_all_file_paths_recursive` created to support this. Direct manipulation of `node.selection_state` in this function is superseded by `selected_paths` update triggering `use_effect`.)
*   [x] **Task 7.2:** In `FileTreeNodeDisplay`, add an `oninput` event handler to the checkbox.
*   [x] **Task 7.3:** The `oninput` handler should:
    *   Get the new checked state (`event.value().as_bool().unwrap_or(false)`).
    *   Call a method/closure that uses `set_node_and_descendants_state` on the current node. This requires mutable access to the tree structure or a way to trigger updates on signals. This is where Dioxus's state management philosophy is key. We might need to rebuild parts of the tree or update signals that `build_tree_from_file_info` depends on.
    *   A more Dioxus-idiomatic way: the checkbox `oninput` updates the `selected_paths` signal directly (add/remove path for files, add/remove all descendant paths for folders). Then, `use_effect` recalculates all `selection_state` signals in the tree.

*Alternative for 7.3 (more Dioxus idiomatic):*
*   [x] **Task 7.3 (Revised):** The checkbox `oninput` handler:
    *   Reads the current node's path and type.
    *   If it's a file: toggles its presence in `props.selected_paths`.
    *   If it's a folder: iterates through all its descendant file paths and adds/removes them from `props.selected_paths` based on the new checked state.
    *   This direct manipulation of `props.selected_paths` will trigger the `use_effect` in `FileTree` to rebuild/recalculate node states.

---

### Story 8: Implement Selection Logic (Part 2 - Ancestor State Updates)

**Description:** Implement logic to update the selection state of ancestor folders based on the state of their children. This ensures folders become "partially selected" or "fully selected" correctly.

*   [x] **Task 8.1:** Create a helper function `calculate_folder_selection_state(folder_node: &FileTreeNode) -> NodeSelectionState` in `src/components/file_tree.rs`.
    *   Iterate through `folder_node.children`.
    *   If all children are `Selected`, folder is `Selected`.
    *   If all children are `NotSelected`, folder is `NotSelected`.
    *   Otherwise, folder is `PartiallySelected`.
    *   Handle case of no children (folder itself can be selected if treated as a selectable target, or reflects its own direct selection state if that's allowed). For now, assume folders primarily derive state from children files.
*   [x] **Task 8.2:** Modify the `use_effect` in `FileTree` (that calls `build_tree_from_file_info`). After the initial tree build and descendant propagation from `selected_paths`, iterate through the tree (bottom-up or with multiple passes) to apply `calculate_folder_selection_state` to correctly set `selection_state` for all folder nodes.
    *   This ensures that when `selected_paths` changes, the entire tree's visual state is consistent.

---

### Story 9: Integrate `Select All` / `Deselect All` Functionality

**Description:** Connect the `on_select_all` and `on_deselect_all` props from `FileTreeProps` to update the selection state of all file nodes in the tree.

*   [ ] **Task 9.1:** In `FileTree` component, when `props.on_select_all` is triggered:
    *   Collect all file paths from `props.all_files`.
    *   Update `props.selected_paths` to include all these file paths.
*   [ ] **Task 9.2:** In `FileTree` component, when `props.on_deselect_all` is triggered:
    *   Clear the `props.selected_paths` HashSet.
*   [ ] **Task 9.3:** Ensure these actions correctly trigger the `use_effect` to update all `FileTreeNode` selection states.

---

### Story 10: Component Tests for `FileTree`

**Description:** Write tests for the `FileTree` component, focusing on rendering, interactions, and state changes. (Dioxus testing can be limited; focus on logical units if direct component interaction testing is hard).

*   [ ] **Task 10.1:** Write tests in `src/components/file_tree_test.rs` for basic rendering:
    *   Test that a simple tree structure renders with correct names and icons.
*   [ ] **Task 10.2:** Test folder expansion/collapse logic (if testable by manipulating `is_expanded` signal and checking output).
*   [ ] **Task 10.3:** Test checkbox state updates:
    *   Simulate changes to `selected_paths` and verify that checkboxes and `NodeSelectionState` update correctly for files, direct parent folders, and ancestor folders (Selected, NotSelected, PartiallySelected).
*   [ ] **Task 10.4:** Test `Select All` and `Deselect All` functionality by simulating the event and checking `selected_paths` and subsequently the node states.
*   [ ] **Task 10.5:** Write unit tests for `
