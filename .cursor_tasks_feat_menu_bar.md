Native File Menu Implementation (File → Open, Recent Workspaces)

Story: Integrate Native Menu Bar
	- [x] Define constants: In src/main.rs, define a constant (e.g. const MAX_RECENTS: usize = 5;) for the maximum number of recent workspaces.
	- [x] Use LaunchBuilder: Replace the existing dioxus::desktop::launch(app) in src/main.rs with a dioxus::LaunchBuilder. Import dioxus::desktop::tao and create a WindowBuilder, e.g.:

use dioxus::desktop::tao;
let window = tao::window::WindowBuilder::new().with_resizable(true);
let config = dioxus::desktop::Config::default()
    .with_window(window)
    .with_menu(None);  // placeholder, to be replaced with actual menu
dioxus::LaunchBuilder::new().with_cfg(config).launch(app);

This matches the official pattern for configuring the window and menu ￼.

	- [x] Add muda menu construction: Add the muda crate via dioxus::desktop::muda (already re-exported) in Cargo.toml and import it in main.rs. Construct a muda::Menu for the app menu. For example:

let mut menu = muda::Menu::new();
let file_menu = muda::Submenu::with_items("File", true, &[]);
menu.push_submenu(&file_menu);

(Adjust as needed to match the repo's menu structure.)

	- [x] Configure menu with LaunchBuilder: After building the muda::Menu, attach it in the Config. Use Config::default().with_window(window).with_menu(Some(menu)) in the LaunchBuilder call ￼, replacing the earlier with_menu(None). This ensures the native menu is used.
	- [x] Attach menu to native UI: Once the window is created, attach the menu to the OS window. On Windows, call unsafe { menu.init_for_hwnd(window_hwnd) }; on Linux, call menu.init_for_gtk_window(&gtk_window, Some(&vertical_gtk_box)); on macOS, call unsafe { menu.init_for_nsapp() } ￼. Use #[cfg(target_os = "...")] to guard platform-specific calls. This makes the File menu appear in the correct native menu bar ￼.

Story: Implement "Open" Menu Action
	- [x] Remove legacy toolbar code: In src/toolbar.rs, remove or comment out the old "Open" button and any code that previously handled opening a file. This avoids duplicate UI elements now that the File menu is the source of truth.
	- [x] Add file-dialog support: Add rfd to Cargo.toml (e.g. rfd = "0.15" or the latest version) for native file dialogs. In code, import rfd::FileDialog.
	- [x] Menu event handler – Open: In a top-level component or main UI code, register a menu event handler using dioxus_desktop::use_muda_event_handler(cx, move |event| { ... }) ￼. In the handler, match event.id against the ID of the "Open" menu item.
	- [x] Show file dialog: When "Open" is selected, call the file dialog synchronously. For example:

if let Some(path) = FileDialog::new().pick_file() {
    // handle opening this workspace file
}

This follows the standard pattern for rfd dialogs ￼. (You can also use .add_filter("Workspace files", &["ext"]) or set an initial directory if needed.)

	- [x] Update workspace state: When a file is chosen, call the existing workspace-loading logic (e.g. load_workspace(path)) and update the application state to the new workspace. Then, update recents: insert this file's path at the front of the recent_workspaces list (defined in settings, see next story), remove any duplicate entry, and truncate the list to MAX_RECENTS. Save the updated settings to settings.json.

Story: Implement "Recent Workspaces" Submenu and Persistence
	- [x] Extend settings struct: In src/settings.rs, add a new field to the settings data structure, e.g.:

#[serde(default)]
pub recent_workspaces: Vec<String>,

Ensure it has #[serde(default)] so older settings.json (without that key) can still load. This list will store file paths or workspace identifiers.

	- [x] Initialize recents: When loading settings at startup, initialize recent_workspaces to an empty Vec if absent. After loading, ensure any workspace path in settings that refers to a recently opened file is valid; if not, remove it. (Optional: validate paths.)
	- [x] Populate Recent Workspaces submenu: Whenever the menu is (re)built, create a Submenu for "Recent Workspaces". Do something like:

let enabled = !settings.recent_workspaces.is_empty();
let mut items = Vec::new();
for path in &settings.recent_workspaces {
    let name = std::path::Path::new(path)
        .file_name()
        .and_then(|s| s.to_str())
        .unwrap_or(path);
    let item = muda::MenuItem::new(name, true, None);
    items.push(item);
}
// Add a separator and "Clear Recent Workspaces"
if enabled {
    items.push(muda::PredefinedMenuItem::separator());
    items.push(muda::MenuItem::new("Clear Recent Workspaces", true, None));
}
let recent_menu = muda::Submenu::with_items("Recent Workspaces", enabled, &items.iter().collect::<Vec<&_>>());
menu.push_submenu(&recent_menu);

If settings.recent_workspaces is empty, pass enabled = false to Submenu::with_items. Likewise, make "Clear Recent Workspaces" disabled (false) if the list is empty. This ensures correct enabling/disabling of the submenu and clear action.

	- [x] Handle Recent item selection: In the use_muda_event_handler callback, detect if the user clicked a recent-workspace item. You may assign each "Recent" menu item a unique ID or compare by its label. On selection, treat it like "Open": load that workspace, move it to the front of the list, and save settings. If "Clear Recent Workspaces" is selected, clear the recent_workspaces list entirely, save settings, and rebuild or disable the submenu. After any change, rebuild or update the native menu so it reflects the new list.

Story: Remove Legacy UI and Clean Up Code
	- [x] Delete or repurpose toolbar.rs: Since the toolbar's "Open" button is obsolete, either delete src/toolbar.rs or remove its contents related to file opening. Update mod declarations and any references to this file in main.rs or other modules.
	- [x] Remove old open-workflow code: Search the codebase for any deprecated "open" workflow (e.g. functions named open_workspace in UI, or legacy bindings) and remove or disable them. Ensure that only the new menu-based code remains.
	- [x] Update documentation/comments: Update any comments or docs that referred to the old toolbar or open mechanism, indicating that the File menu now handles opening.

Story: Platform-Specific Details
	- [x] macOS integration: Guard macOS-specific menu calls with #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]. On macOS, call menu.init_for_nsapp() on the main thread so the File menu appears in the system menu bar (e.g. under the application's name) ￼. Ensure the "About", "Services", and other standard macOS items appear appropriately (you may rely on Muda's defaults or add standard items if needed).
	- [x] Windows/Linux integration: For Windows and Linux, attach the menu to the main application window. For example, obtain the native window handle (via DesktopService or the closure in LaunchBuilder) and call unsafe { menu.init_for_hwnd(hwnd) } (Windows) or menu.init_for_gtk_window(&gtk_window, None) (Linux) ￼. Test that the menu bar appears in the window (not in the system bar).
	- [x] Event loop handling: Confirm that use_muda_event_handler (or the equivalent MenuEvent listener) is registered before the app's event loop runs, so that menu selections wake up the loop. The Dioxus hook use_muda_event_handler ￼ should internally proxy events, but ensure MenuEvent::set_event_handler is set if doing manual event loop integration.
	- [x] Conditional disabling of menu items: Implement logic so that if no recent workspaces exist, the entire "Recent Workspaces" submenu is disabled (enabled = false), and the "Clear" item is disabled too. Once at least one recent is present, re-enable these.

Story: Testing and Verification
	- [x] Cross-platform manual tests: On macOS, Windows, and Linux, verify that a native menu bar appears with the "File" menu. Test that selecting File → Open brings up the OS file-open dialog, and that selecting a file triggers the workspace load and adds it to Recent Workspaces.
	- [x] Persistence check: After opening 1, 3, 6, etc. workspaces (in separate app sessions), exit the app and inspect settings.json. Verify that up to 5 recent workspaces are saved in the correct order (most recent first). On restart, check that the "Recent Workspaces" menu shows exactly those entries and that clicking them re-opens the workspace.
	- [x] Edge cases: Test behavior when "Open" is canceled (no change to recent list), and when reopening an already-listed workspace (it should move to the top of the recent list without duplication). Test "Clear Recent Workspaces" to ensure it empties the list and disables the submenu.
	- [x] Remove old functionality: Confirm that the toolbar no longer contains an "Open" button and that all "Open" functionality flows through the menu. If there were automated tests or UI checks for the toolbar, update or remove them.
	- [x] Regression testing: Run any existing automated tests to ensure nothing else broke. Consider adding tests or examples that simulate menu events (MenuEvent) if your test framework allows it. Document any manual test procedures for future reference.
