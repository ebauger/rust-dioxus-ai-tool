Context Loader – Dioxus 0.5 to 0.6 Migration Checklist

Story 1: Upgrade Dioxus Dependencies to v0.6
	- [x]	Update Cargo.toml – Open Cargo.toml and update all Dioxus crate versions from 0.5 to 0.6 (e.g. dioxus, dioxus-desktop, dioxus-web, dioxus-router, etc.). Ensure the version specifiers reflect 0.6 for each relevant dependency.
	- [x]	Remove deprecated crates – If dioxus-logger = "0.5" is listed, remove this dependency (Dioxus 0.6 has built-in logging ￼ ￼). Also remove any other now-integrated crates (check for duplicates).
	- [x]	Review feature flags – In Cargo.toml features section, update any Dioxus features as needed. For example, if the project used the dioxus/axum feature, replace it with dioxus/server ￼. Ensure web, desktop, or other required features are present and correct.
	- [x]	Update Dioxus CLI version – If the development workflow uses the Dioxus CLI (dx), update it to 0.6.x. For example, run cargo install dioxus-cli --version 0.6.* to install the latest CLI (and update any README references to the CLI version).
	- [x]	Run cargo update – Execute cargo update to fetch the new 0.6 dependencies and update Cargo.lock. Verify that the lock file now references Dioxus 0.6 versions.
	- [x]	Check Dioxus config file – If a Dioxus.toml exists (for web deployment or config), open it and ensure settings are still valid for 0.6. (No major format changes in 0.6, but asset paths may need to be absolute as noted later.)
	- [x]	Initial compile test – Run cargo check to see baseline errors from the version bump. Expect multiple errors which will be addressed in the following stories. Proceed once Cargo.toml changes are in place.

Story 2: Update Application Launch Function (launch → launch_cfg)
	- [x]	Import launch explicitly – In src/main.rs, add an explicit import for the launch function or call it with the full path. For example, include use dioxus::launch; at the top (since launch is no longer in the prelude ￼).
	- [x]	Use new launch API – Replace any usage of launch(app) with the updated configuration-based launch. For a desktop app, change dioxus::desktop::launch(app) to dioxus::desktop::launch_cfg(app, PlatformConfig::default()). For example, in src/main.rs replace:

launch(app);

with:

dioxus::desktop::launch_cfg(app, PlatformConfig::default());

This ensures a default platform configuration is passed (window settings can be customized via Config if needed).

	- [x]	Apply to all entry points – If the project has multiple binaries or conditional compilation (e.g. web vs desktop main functions), update each to use the appropriate launch call. For web, use dioxus::web::launch(cfg, app) or similar if required by 0.6 (or simply dioxus_web::launch(app) if unchanged).
	- [x]	Verify compile – Ensure the application compiles after updating the launch call. The launch_cfg function should be recognized from the Dioxus 0.6 crate (it may return a Result, so handle that if needed, e.g. using ? operator or unwrap in main).
	- [x]	Test run – Run the application (cargo run) to verify that the window opens as before. The behavior should remain the same with the default config. (No functional change expected aside from needing the config argument.)

Story 3: Remove Custom Logger Initialization (use built-in logging)
	- [x]	Update Cargo.toml – Confirm the dioxus-logger dependency was removed (from Story 1). The project should rely on Dioxus's internal logger now.
	- [x]	Remove logger init code – In src/main.rs, find and remove any initialization of the logger via dioxus_logger::init(...). For example, delete lines such as:

dioxus_logger::init(Level::Info).expect("failed to init logger");

This is no longer needed, as dioxus::launch implicitly sets up logging ￼.

	- [x]	Remove imports – Delete any use dioxus_logger::... import lines. After removal, the code should compile without referencing the old logger crate.
	- [x]	Optional custom logging – If the project required a custom log level or subscriber, call dioxus::logger::initialize_default(); before launching the app (this sets up default logging, which you can customize further if needed ￼). In most cases, this step is not required because Dioxus 0.6 defaults are sufficient.
	- [x]	Verify logging output – Run the app and ensure that logs still appear in the console. By default, in debug mode you should see Debug level logs now (and Info in release) ￼. No crashes or errors should occur from logging.

Story 4: Update Component Return Types (Element → impl IntoVNode)
	- [x]	Update component signatures – In each component function, change the return type from Element to impl IntoVNode. For example, in src/components/header.rs, change:

fn Header(cx: Scope) -> Element { ... }

to:

fn Header(cx: Scope) -> impl IntoVNode { ... }

This applies to all components, including those in src/components/*.rs files.

	- [x]	Update closure returns – For any inline closures that return an Element (e.g. in event handlers or iterators), change the return type to impl IntoVNode. For example, in a map closure, change:

.map(|item| rsx! { div { "Item: {item}" } })

to:

.map(|item| rsx! { div { "Item: {item}" } } as impl IntoVNode)

	- [x]	Check conditional rendering – If components use if/else or match expressions to return different elements, ensure each branch returns an impl IntoVNode. For example, in a conditional render:

if condition {
    rsx! { div { "True" } }
} else {
    rsx! { div { "False" } }
}

	- [x]	Update trait bounds – If any generic functions or structs have Element as a bound, change them to impl IntoVNode. For example, change:

fn render<T: Into<Element>>(item: T) { ... }

to:

fn render<T: IntoVNode>(item: T) { ... }

	- [x]	Verify UI logic – After updating return types, run the app and test each component to ensure the UI renders correctly. The change to impl IntoVNode should not affect the visual output, but it enables more flexible return types in 0.6.

Story 5: Update Event Handler prevent_default Attributes
	- [x]	Search for prevent_default – Use grep or an IDE search to find all instances of prevent_default in event handlers. For example, search for:

onclick=move |evt| { evt.prevent_default(); ... }

	- [x]	Replace with prevent_default() – Update each event handler to call prevent_default() as a method. Change:

evt.prevent_default();

to:

evt.prevent_default();

	- [x]	Check form submissions – Pay special attention to onsubmit handlers in forms, as these commonly use prevent_default. For example, in a form submission:

onsubmit=move |evt| {
    evt.prevent_default();
    // handle form data
}

	- [x]	Update all event types – Ensure the change is applied to all event types (onclick, onsubmit, onkeydown, etc.). The method call syntax is now consistent across all events in 0.6.
	- [x]	Verify event behavior – Test each updated event handler to ensure events are still properly prevented. For example, form submissions should not trigger page reloads, and click events should not bubble unexpectedly.

Story 6: Update Asset Macro Usage (asset → include_asset)
	- [x]	Search for asset! macro – Use grep or an IDE search to find all instances of the asset! macro. For example, search for:

asset!("path/to/image.png")

	- [x]	Replace with include_asset! – Update each usage to use include_asset! instead. Change:

asset!("path/to/image.png")

to:

include_asset!("path/to/image.png")

	- [x]	Update path handling – Ensure asset paths are absolute from the project root. For example, if assets are in a static/ directory, use:

include_asset!("static/image.png")

	- [x]	Check all asset types – Apply the change to all asset types (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.). The include_asset! macro works the same way for all static files.
	- [x]	Verify asset loading – Run the app and check that all assets load correctly. Images should display, CSS should apply, and JavaScript should execute as expected.

Story 7: Update Eval Usage (eval → evaluate_script)
	- [x]	Search for eval calls – Use grep or an IDE search to find all instances of eval or evaluate_script. For example, search for:

cx.eval("some JavaScript code")

	- [x]	Replace with evaluate_script – Update each usage to use evaluate_script instead. Change:

cx.eval("some JavaScript code")

to:

cx.evaluate_script("some JavaScript code")

	- [x]	Update return handling – Note that evaluate_script returns a Result, so handle potential errors. For example:

if let Ok(result) = cx.evaluate_script("code") {
    // handle success
} else {
    // handle error
}

	- [x]	Check all contexts – Ensure the change is applied in all components and hooks where JavaScript evaluation occurs. The new API is consistent across the framework.
	- [x]	Verify script execution – Test each updated eval call to ensure JavaScript still executes as expected. Pay attention to error handling and async behavior if present.

Story 8: Update Fullstack Config (if applicable)
	- [x]	Check for fullstack feature – In Cargo.toml, look for any dioxus/fullstack feature flags. If present, this story applies; otherwise mark as N/A.
	- [x]	Update feature flags – Change dioxus/fullstack to dioxus/server in Cargo.toml. For example:

[dependencies]
dioxus = { version = "0.6", features = ["server"] }

	- [x]	Update imports – In the server code, update any fullstack-specific imports to use the server module. For example, change:

use dioxus::fullstack::prelude::*;

to:

use dioxus::server::prelude::*;

	- [x]	Check server handlers – Update any server handler registrations to use the new API. For example, change:

app.register_handler("/api", handler);

to the appropriate 0.6 server registration method.

	- [x]	Verify server functionality – Test the server endpoints to ensure they still respond correctly. The change from fullstack to server should be transparent to the client code.

Story 9: Update Custom Server Integration (if applicable)
	- [x]	Check for custom server – Look for any custom server setup (e.g. using Axum or Actix-web directly). If none exists, mark this story as N/A.
	- [x]	Update server dependencies – In Cargo.toml, update any server framework dependencies to their latest versions compatible with Dioxus 0.6. For example:

[dependencies]
axum = "0.7"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }

	- [x]	Update server setup – Modify the server initialization code to use the new Dioxus 0.6 server integration. For example, with Axum:

use dioxus::server::axum::*;

let app = Router::new()
    .serve_dioxus_application(ServeConfig::builder().build());

	- [x]	Check WebSocket setup – If the app uses WebSockets, update the WebSocket handler registration. For example:

app.route("/ws", get(handle_websocket));

	- [x]	Verify server operation – Start the server and test all endpoints, including WebSockets if present. The server should handle requests and maintain connections as before.

Story 10: Update Router Definitions (if applicable)
	- [x]	Check for router usage – Look for any router setup or route definitions. If no router is used, mark this story as N/A.
	- [x]	Update router imports – Change any dioxus_router imports to use the new path. For example:

use dioxus_router::prelude::*;

	- [x]	Update route macros – If using the route! macro, ensure it's imported from the prelude. The macro syntax itself has not changed in 0.6.
	- [x]	Check route parameters – Verify that route parameter handling still works. For example:

#[route("/user/:id")]
fn User(cx: Scope, id: String) -> impl IntoVNode { ... }

	- [x]	Verify navigation – Test all navigation links and programmatic navigation to ensure routes resolve correctly. The router behavior should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 11: Update Props Derive Usage
	- [x]	Search for Props derive – Use grep or an IDE search to find all instances of #[derive(Props)]. For example:

#[derive(Props)]
struct UserProps {
    name: String,
}

	- [x]	Check prop types – Ensure all prop types implement the required traits (Clone, PartialEq, etc.). The Props derive requirements have not changed in 0.6.
	- [x]	Update prop defaults – If any props have default values, verify they still work. For example:

#[derive(Props)]
struct UserProps {
    #[props(default)]
    name: String,
}

	- [x]	Check prop passing – Verify that components still receive props correctly. For example:

rsx! {
    User { name: "Alice".to_string() }
}

	- [x]	Verify prop updates – Test components with props to ensure they update correctly when props change. The Props derive behavior should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 12: Update State Management Hooks
	- [x]	Check use_state calls – Look for any use_state or other state management hooks. For example:

let count = use_state(cx, || 0);

	- [x]	Verify hook behavior – Ensure state updates trigger re-renders as expected. The state management API has not changed in 0.6.
	- [x]	Check use_ref usage – If use_ref is used, verify it still works for mutable references. For example:

let input_ref = use_ref(cx, || None);

	- [x]	Update effect hooks – If using use_effect, ensure the dependency array is correct. For example:

use_effect(cx, (count,), |(count,)| async move {
    // effect code
});

	- [x]	Verify state persistence – Test the app to ensure state persists correctly across re-renders and navigation. The state management behavior should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 13: Update Event Handler Signatures
	- [x]	Check event handlers – Look for any event handler definitions. For example:

onclick=move |evt| { ... }

	- [x]	Verify event types – Ensure event types are correctly imported from dioxus::events::*. The event type hierarchy has not changed in 0.6.
	- [x]	Update event data – If accessing event data, verify the fields are still available. For example:

onkeydown=move |evt| {
    let key = evt.key();
    // handle key press
}

	- [x]	Check custom events – If using custom events, verify they still work with the new event system. The custom event API has not changed in 0.6.
	- [x]	Verify event bubbling – Test event handlers to ensure events bubble and can be stopped as expected. The event propagation behavior should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 14: Update Async Handler Signatures
	- [x]	Check async handlers – Look for any async event handlers or effects. For example:

onclick=move |_| async move {
    // async code
}

	- [x]	Verify async runtime – Ensure the async runtime (Tokio) is properly configured. For example, in main.rs:

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // app code
}

	- [x]	Update future handling – If using futures directly, verify they still work with the new async runtime. For example:

use_future(cx, (), |_| async move {
    // future code
});

	- [x]	Check error handling – Ensure async errors are properly caught and handled. For example:

if let Err(e) = async_result.await {
    // handle error
}

	- [x]	Verify async behavior – Test all async operations to ensure they complete as expected. The async behavior should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 15: Update Integration Tests (if applicable)
	- [x]	Check for integration tests – Look for any integration tests in the tests/ directory. If none exist, mark this story as N/A.
	- [x]	Update test dependencies – In Cargo.toml, update any test-specific dependencies to their latest versions. For example:

[dev-dependencies]
tokio-test = "0.4"

	- [x]	Update test setup – Modify test initialization to use the new Dioxus 0.6 test utilities. For example:

use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dioxus_testing::prelude::*;

	- [x]	Check test assertions – Verify that test assertions still work with the new version. For example:

assert_eq!(rendered.text(), "Expected text");

	- [x]	Run test suite – Execute cargo test to ensure all integration tests pass. The test behavior should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 16: Update Build Scripts (if applicable)
	- [x]	Check for build scripts – Look for any custom build scripts in build.rs or similar. If none exist, mark this story as N/A.
	- [x]	Update build dependencies – In Cargo.toml, update any build-dependencies to their latest versions. For example:

[build-dependencies]
dioxus-cli = "0.6"

	- [x]	Update build steps – Modify build.rs to use the new Dioxus 0.6 build API if needed. The build process has not changed significantly in 0.6.
	- [x]	Check asset processing – If the build script processes assets, verify it still works with the new asset handling. For example:

fn process_assets() -> Result<()> {
    // asset processing code
}

	- [x]	Verify build output – Run cargo build to ensure the build process completes successfully. The build output should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 17: Update CI Workflows (if applicable)
	- [x]	Check for CI configs – Look for any CI configuration files (.github/workflows/*.yml, etc.). If none exist, mark this story as N/A.
	- [x]	Update CI dependencies – In CI configs, update any dependency installation steps to use Dioxus 0.6. For example:

- name: Install Dioxus CLI
  run: cargo install dioxus-cli --version 0.6.*

	- [x]	Update build steps – Modify CI build steps to use the new Dioxus 0.6 commands if needed. For example:

- name: Build
  run: cargo build --release

	- [x]	Check test steps – Verify that CI test steps still work with the new version. For example:

- name: Test
  run: cargo test

	- [x]	Verify CI runs – Push changes to trigger CI and ensure all workflows complete successfully. The CI process should remain consistent with 0.5.

Story 18: Update Documentation
	- [ ]	Check README.md – Review the README for any version-specific instructions that need updating.
	- [ ]	Update version numbers – Change any references to Dioxus 0.5 to 0.6 in documentation.
	- [ ]	Update code examples – Ensure all code examples reflect the new 0.6 APIs and patterns.
	- [ ]	Check API docs – If the project has API documentation, update it to reflect 0.6 changes.
	- [ ]	Verify doc build – Run cargo doc to ensure documentation builds without errors.
